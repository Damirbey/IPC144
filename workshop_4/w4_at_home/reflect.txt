Answers:
=>We declared arrays to have 10 elements, because maximum number of days was 10.
That was the reason why I declared my arrays to hold 10 elements.
=> Advantages are: arrays can hold multiple elements of the same type. In other words we can 
assign multiple elements of the same type to a single array.
Disadvantage: We must know in advance how many elements are to be stored in an array.And
sometimes not all elements of an arrays are occupied with the value and that is why 
we can waste resources of our memory.
=>At home section of this workshop was a little bit tricky, because we had to use multiple 
loops in our program. First do while loop was used to get value of up to how many days we have to
find the average temperature. Second for loop was used to find sum of temperatures of certain
number of days which was requested by the user.

Quiz 2 Reflection:

=> In question number 11 my answer was incomplete because I did say that loop was infinite. 
So loop in question 11 of quiz 2 was infinite loop.
