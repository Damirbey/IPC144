=> In this workshop 1, I learned how to create a simple C program that displays a text to a user.
In addition , I got familiar with remote server "Matrix" and learned how to transfer my files from a local machine to a Matrix.
On the other hand, exercises that were provided were very useful to get familiar with the "\n"-> new line character which is very important when dealing with displaying a text.
Thank you very much.
