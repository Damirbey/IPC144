Answers:
=>All iteration constructs in C programming language are: For loop, while loop and do while loop.
=>Difference between (while loop) and (do while loops) is that (do while loop) will execute a statement before
checking the condition at least once , while at the same time (while loop) will first check the conditions than
if the condition is true it will execute the consecutive statements.
=>Conditional operators are used to evaluate a condition that's applied to one or two boolean expressions. 
The result of the evaluation is either true or false. Conditional operators are: && the logical AND operator, || the logical OR operator.
&&->Both statements must be TRUE.
||-> One TRUE statement is enough to perform a task.
